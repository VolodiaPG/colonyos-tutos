# Getting started
In this tutorial, we will explore how ColonyOS can be effectively be used for processing earth observation data. We are going to use a service called OpenEO, which is a service part of the Digital Earth Sweden platform. By combining the capabilities of ColonyOS with the advanced features offered by OpenEO, we will demonstrate how to efficiently handle, analyze, and derive valuable insights from large-scale geospatial datasets.

## Overview
ColonyOS is a meta-operating system and should be conceptualized as such, despite being distributed where underlying components could potentially be spread across a geographically dispersed *compute continuum*. In a traditional operating system, applications are typically stored on a filesystem, like a hard drive. Similarly, in ColonyOS, we will store applications, such as Python scripts, on ColonyFS and use it just as we would with a conventional operating system.
