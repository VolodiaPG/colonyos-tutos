# Introduction

This repo contains several tutorials to help you get started with ColonyOS, an open-source meta-operating system (middleware) developed by RISE AB. ColonyOS provides a unified programming model to execute workloads across diverse platforms, from traditional cloud infrastructures and HPC to emergent edge platforms. 

1. [Getting started](1-getting-started/tutorial.md)
    - This is an introductory tutorial that will guide you through the initial setup and basic operations.

2. [ColonyFS](2-colonyfs/tutorial.md)
    - Learn about ColonyFS, a built-in meta-filesystem designed to simplify data transfer between executors and application while ensuring data integrity with features such as immutable snapshots.

3. [Python SDK](3-python/tutorial.md)
    - Dive into the Python SDK to understand how to develop custom executors, and integrate and automate tasks using Python scripts.

4. [Serverless computing](4-faas/tutorial.md)
    - This tutorial explores how to build a serverless computing platform with ColonyOS, allowing you to run functions *(Function-as-a-Service)* on demand.

5. [Workflows](5-workflows/tutorial.md)
    - Explore how to create and manage complex workflows, allowing you to define dependencies and automate processes across different computing environments.

6. [Pollinator](6-pollinator/tutorial.md)
    - Learn how to use the Pollinator tool for batch processing.

7. [Security](7-security/tutorial.md)
    - Learn about ColonyOS security features, including best practices and tools to ensure your deployments are secure.

8. [Production deployment](8-production/tutorial.md) 
    - Learn how to deploy ColonyOS on a Kubernetes cluster for production use.

9. [K8s Executor](9-k8s-executor/tutorial.md)
    - Deploy a K8s Executor to run processes as Kubernetes batch jobs.

10. [HPC Executor](10-hpc-executor/tutorial.md)
    - Deploy a HPC Executor to run processes as Slurm batch jobs.
